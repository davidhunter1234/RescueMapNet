# RescueMapNet
SDP2024

Here lays the software for the Rescue MapNet. There are two core features of this system:
  * Map Interface
  * LoRa mesh communication

1. Map Interface
Leaflet.js is a popular open source Java library for interactive maps. It is high customizable and is able to draw lines to connect a list of GPS coordinates.

The range of the map interface will be limited to Massachusetts for convienence and simplicity. Rescue MapNet composes of multiple devices which should be able to serve the map interface while offline (away from any internet or cellular network).
